    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a machine learning-based crop recommendation system that uses KMeans clustering to suggest the best crops to grow based on various soil and environmental parameters.</p>
    <p>The model considers features like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall to cluster and recommend crops that would yield the best results.</p>
    <p>It is developed using Flask for the backend, HTML for the frontend, and scikit-learn for the machine learning pipeline.</p>
